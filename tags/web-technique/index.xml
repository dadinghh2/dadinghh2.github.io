      <description>Introduction of HugoUnlike other frameworks like Jekyll and Hexo, which are developed for personal blog building, Hugo is a general-purpose website framework, also a static site generator. Hugo is developed by Go language and has a very fast responsive speed. I chose Hugo because it allows the author to post not only blogs but also some other things like docs, portfolios, etc. Hope you will enjoy Hugo just like me!</description>
